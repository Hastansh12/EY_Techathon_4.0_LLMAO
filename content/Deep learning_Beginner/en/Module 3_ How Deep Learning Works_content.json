        "content": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model and solve complex problems. It is based on the idea of building artificial neural networks with multiple layers, called deep neural networks, that can learn hierarchical representations of the data. Some of the key characteristics and working of deep learning include the Perceptron, deep architecture, neural networks, and training. Deep learning offers many advantages, including high accuracy and scalability; however, it also has some disadvantages, such as high computational requirements, the need for large amounts of labeled data, and interpretability challenges. It is essential to carefully consider these limitations when deciding whether to use deep learning for a specific application.",
